Welcome to my learning journey as I work towards becoming a Google Interview ready software developer.
In this project, I will be documenting my progress and sharing my insights and experiences as I tackle
various coding challenges, improve my problem-solving skills, and expand my knowledge of computer science.

My goal in this journey is to prepare myself for the rigorous technical interview process at Google and other
top tech companies. I will be focusing on mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms, as well as
improving my coding skills in languages such as Java and Python. Additionally, I will be exploring topics
such as system design, object-oriented programming, and software engineering principles.

Throughout this project, I will be sharing my thought process, the resources I use, and the techniques I employ
to solve challenging problems. I hope that my journey can serve as a helpful guide for others who are also
on the path towards becoming a Google Interview ready software developer.

So, join me as I embark on this exciting and challenging journey!


Sincerely,
Mervan Polat
